What is Framework
=========================
=> Framework is a semi developed software

=> Frameworks providing common logics for application development

=> If we use frameworks then we need to focus only on business logic

=> Using frameworks we can do more work in less time (productivity)

=> We have several frameworks in java community

      1) JSF -----------> outdated
      2) Hibernate -----> data jpa
      3) Struts -------> out dated
      4) Spring ---> SpringBoot ----> trending


=> Hibernate is an ORM framework.
=> ORM means Object Relational Mapping
=> Using Hibernate we can develop persistence layer
=> Hibernate developed on top of JDBC.


=> Struts framework developed by Apache
=> Struts is used to develop only web layer

in Struts Framework , There is not any provision for Database connectivity, So we used hibernate for this purpose.

=> Spring is called as application development framework
=> Using spring we can develop entire application including DB connectivity
=> Spring is free of cost & open source
=> Spring framework provides common logics required for application development.

Note: SpringBoot is an extension for Spring Framework.
